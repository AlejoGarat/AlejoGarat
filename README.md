## About Me

Hi there! 👋 I am Alejo Garat, a computer engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Here's a bit more about me:

- 🎓 I am a Computer Engineer.
- 👨‍🏫 I also work as an Artificial Intelligence lecturer.

## Projects

Here are some projects I've been working on:

- [GraphRNNAutomaton](https://github.com/AlejoGarat/GraphRNNAutomaton): utilized a GraphRNN architecture to generate Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) with specific properties.
- [Neural-Checker](https://github.com/neuralchecker): its main goal is to provide implementations for the structures needed for working in the Model Extraction Framework and enable the explainability and checking of complex systems in a black box context.
